me hope to prototype some python to fetch yfinance quotes and CRUD
a firebaseDB table. table updates should be automagically asynchronously
relay to all interested/connected clients (Google MOM)! should be $$
free, up to some threshold of space and bandwidth.

cron job can periodically dump/empty firebaseDB to a PostGIS DB on
my wholesaleinternet.net hosts, before any costs incurred.
 
write a simple HTML5 client firebaseDB SPA webapp that consumes the feed(s) to monitor.

PostGIS DB will potentially someday have some value.
